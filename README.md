#  Electricity Demand Forecast Project

A data-science project analyzing and forecasting electricity demand in Germany. First step, training prediction models, based on the historical (2015-2020) **Open Power System Data (OPSD)** dataset, combined with  **German holiday data** and **weather data**.
